<p>One of the easiest ways to protect wetland habitats is to purchase property. By purchasing property, we can manipulate the land. 
We can create a sustainable habitat for waterfowl, provide a flood plain for neighboring cities, and protect the land from 
commercial/ residential development.</p>
<p><span class="boldtext">Waterfowl</span> tend to favor <span class="italictext">water</span> depth between 2-3 feet. We can create leveies by buldozing earthen walls and add a simple gravel 
road ontop of the walls. The water would come from the nearby Missori river. When the river floods, we open the flood gates which allows
water into Brendan's area. This would raise the water level from 0 feet in the summer to 2-4 feet in the fall. This would provide Brendan's
area with fresh water, and buffer the cities from common flooding.</p>

<p>One of the most amazing features of waterfowl is herd memory. They instinctivley know how and to migrate to. At Brendan's
we will have an area which will not be open to hunting. This will ensure the waterfowl have an area where they can eat, rest and not 
be preassured. It's very common for them to stay in these non-huntable areas until it's time to migrate further south. This is not 
seen by hunters as a problem, but a solution. It ensures that future generations will be able to hunt by not harvesting all the ducks.</p>

<h3>Limit exposure</h3>
<p><span class=" boldtext italictext">Electronic</span> sign in and club memberships will limit the number of hunters allowed. This will creat oportunities for both the waterfowl, \
and hunters. The goal of Brendan's in not to harvest all the ducks, but to allow for a heathly combination of harvesting and resting. 
Electronic sign in and gates will help prevent poaching, and memberships funds will go towards planting food for the waterfowl, area 
maintennace, and special projects for the wetland.</p>
