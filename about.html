<h1>The Method</h1>
<p> Conserving The Future's mission is to provide our progengy both the capability to hunt sustainably and protect the wetlands. This is achived through 
a call to action and a call to education.</p>

 
<h2>A call to action</h2>
<p> Other organizations rely on a large pool of money in order to achive it's desired outcome. We feel that action speaks louder than money. Through volenteer's we are 
able to maintain the same wetlands with a fraction of the money. We do not neet to hire contractors to build impoundments, we can achive this ourselves. We need less
money and more decisive action.</p>

<h3>A call to education</h3>
<p>The Canvasback duck was almost hunted into extinction. It was illegal to hunt them for almost 40 years. Through conservation efforts, their numbers have 
improved enouugh to harvest one a year. In the past, people knew little of the biological requirements of various species. This resulted in a lack of 
respect for these animals and a way to harvest them ethically. We offer in class, or group discussions free of charge tailored to the specific age group. 
Only through education can we expect people to respect these animals and their homes. </p>
